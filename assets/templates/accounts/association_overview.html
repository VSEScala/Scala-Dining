    <h3>Association balance</h3>
    <p>
        The balance shows how much money your association owes to others (if it's negative).
        For example when a user deposits money on their account via your association, your association receives
        physical money from that user, but that money remains theirs.
        Therefore the association balance decreases to indicate that the association owes money to that user.
